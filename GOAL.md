# Project Goals - CUTI Enhancement

## Primary Objective
Transform CUTI into a sophisticated AI orchestration platform that seamlessly integrates Claude Code with task management, enabling autonomous project execution.

## Master Goals

### 1. Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Implement hierarchical todo system with master/sub-list support
- [ ] Create real-time sync between Claude Code and web interface
- [ ] Build robust queue system for task distribution
- [ ] Establish database persistence for all operations

### 2. Claude Code Integration
- [ ] Capture and persist TodoWrite operations from Claude
- [ ] Implement bi-directional communication with Claude agents
- [ ] Create agent-specific task assignment system
- [ ] Build context preservation across sessions

### 3. User Experience
- [ ] Design intuitive hierarchical todo visualization
- [ ] Implement real-time progress tracking
- [ ] Create interactive goal management interface
- [ ] Build comprehensive analytics dashboard

### 4. Automation & Intelligence
- [ ] Automatic task breakdown from high-level goals
- [ ] Smart priority assignment based on dependencies
- [ ] Predictive completion time estimates
- [ ] Automated blocker detection and resolution

### 5. Multi-Agent Orchestration
- [ ] Enable multiple Claude agents working in parallel
- [ ] Implement task distribution algorithms
- [ ] Create inter-agent communication protocol
- [ ] Build conflict resolution mechanisms

## Success Criteria

1. **Functionality**
   - Claude can read and update master goals
   - All TodoWrite operations are captured and stored
   - Real-time sync between all components
   - Full CRUD operations on hierarchical todos

2. **Performance**
   - Sub-second response times for all operations
   - Handle 100+ concurrent todos
   - Support 10+ active Claude sessions
   - Zero data loss on system failures

3. **Usability**
   - Intuitive UI requiring no documentation
   - Clear goal → task → subtask hierarchy
   - One-click task assignment to agents
   - Visual progress indicators at all levels

## Dependencies

- **Phase 1**: Todo system, Goal parser, CLAUDE.md integration
- **Phase 2**: Real-time sync, WebSocket implementation
- **Phase 3**: Queue integration, Multi-agent support
- **Phase 4**: Analytics, ML predictions

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Core infrastructure and Claude integration
- **Week 2**: UI enhancement and real-time features
- **Week 3**: Automation and intelligence layers
- **Week 4**: Multi-agent orchestration and optimization

## Notes

This master goal list should be:
- Regularly updated as tasks complete
- Synced with Claude's understanding via CLAUDE.md
- Used as the source of truth for project direction
- Broken down into executable sub-tasks by Claude
